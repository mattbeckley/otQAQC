* Tasks
- [ ] PDAL logs created
- [ ] LAZ files exist?
- [ ] Are there any empty files?
- [ ] QA/QC on CRS and version of LAZ files - is it uniform?
- [ ] plot georeferenced LAZ to verify that the CRS in metadata is
      actually what the data is in (i.e. don't trust metadata?)
- [ ] Boundary created
- [ ] Area of boundary verified?
- [ ] Header values match input (i.e. nothing was accidentally altered)
- [ ] File counts match (for both rasters and pc)
- [ ] Rasters in tiff format?
- [ ] Rasters contain CRS info?
- [ ] Rasters all in same CRS?
- [ ] Rasters in same data type 
- [ ] if Orthos present, tile and compress to reduce size
- [ ] Is DSM > DEM?
- [ ] Can VRT be built?
- [ ] Does Raster boundary match lidar boundary?  Are there gaps
- [ ] Put Metadata into PDF format if necessary.
- [ ] Create registration page on xx/xx/xxxx
- [ ] Add logo to registration
- [ ] Create tile index for shapefiles 
- [ ] Verify that tile index is in cloud
- [ ] Uploaded LAZ, and rasters with rsync to beta on xx/xx/xxxx
- [ ] Add dataset to PI DataProvider List for metrics.
- [ ] Check if LAZ/Raster are enabled for differencing
      https://portal.opentopography.org/addDifferencing
      https://portal.opentopography.org/addRasterDifferencing
- [ ] Make sure Minh: Copies to SDSC Cloud for bulk downloads
- [ ] Make sure Minh: Updates KML for “Find Data” Map
- [ ] Make sure Minh: Inserts record to GeoPortal
- [ ] Update Excel spreadsheet.
