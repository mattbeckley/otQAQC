* Tasks
- [ ] PDAL logs created
- [ ] LAZ files exist?
- [ ] QA/QC on CRS and version of LAZ files - is it uniform?
- [ ] plot georeferenced LAZ to verify that the CRS in metadata is
      actually what the data is in (i.e. don't trust metadata?)
- [ ] Boundary created
- [ ] Area of boundary verified?
- [ ] Header values match input (i.e. nothing was accidentally altered)
- [ ] File counts match (for both rasters and pc)
- [ ] Rasters in tiff format?
- [ ] Rasters contain CRS info?
- [ ] Rasters all in same CRS?
- [ ] Rasters in same data type 
- [ ] Is DSM > DEM?
- [ ] Can VRT be built?
- [ ] Does Raster boundary match lidar boundary?  Are there gaps
- [ ] Put Metadata into PDF format if necessary.
- [ ] Create registration page on xx/xx/xxxx
- [ ] Add logo to registration
- [ ] Uploaded LAZ, and rasters with rsync to beta on xx/xx/xxxx
- [ ] When data is made public, notify Minh to turn on "Bulk Download"
      option.
- [ ] When data is made public add project to PI's registration page so
      they can see stats on their dataset (if applicable)
- [ ] When data is made public, add to Catalog Service for the Web (CSW)

   -  Projection: 
   -  Original LAS/LAZ file count:  
   -  Original files are in la? 1.x 

* Bounds

**  Area
-   km^2.  My calcs matched QGIS.  Metadata reports 

*  Metadata

*  CRS checks
-  all files are in EPSG: and version 1.x

* Rasters
* Beta Testing
-  [ ] check all links
-  [ ] download and check boundary kml
-  [ ] check DOI
-  [ ] download and check metadata
-  [ ] Check LAS Validation report
-  [ ] Check Citation
-  [ ] Check that las and laz contain proper CRS info
-  [ ] Check that OT rasters contain CRS and plot in a GIS


* Prod testing
